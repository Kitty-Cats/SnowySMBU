          HOW TO PLAY
  (Hacked Wii U|Regular Music)
---------------------------------

Requirements:
- Wii U
- SD Card with Homebrew
- A way to load Homebrew


Step 1: Download [SDCafiine](https://github.com/Maschell/SDCafiine/releases/download/1.4/sdcafiine.1.4.zip)

Step 2: Extract the contents of the zip you downloaded to the root of your SD Card

Step 3: Create a folder named "SDCafiine" on the root of your SD Card

Step 4: Inside the "SDCafiine" folder you created, create a new folder that has the name of your title id of your version of NSMBU. *Luigi U works as well, but it'll the levels will be much easier since you have luigi physics and you'll have to copy the "course_res_pack" & "EU"/"US" folders into a new folder named "RDashRes" inside of the "content" folder*

```
NSMBU EU: "0005000010101e00"
NSMBU US: "0005000010101d00"
NSMBU JP: "0005000010101c00"
NSLU EU: "0005000010142400"
NSLU US: "0005000010142300"
NSLU JP: "0005000010142200"
NSMBU + NSLU EU: "000500001014b800"
NSMBU + NSLU US: "000500001014b700"
```

Step 6: Copy the content folder located inside the "SnowyU-noCustomMusic.zip" file into the folder you created(the one inside the "SDCafiine" folder on your SD Card)

Step 7: Power on your Wii U and launch the Homebrew Launcher using your preferred method.

Step 8: Select the 'SDCafiine' app and launch it, If everything went correctly you should be sent back to the home menu.

Step 9: Launch New Super Mario Bros. U(either by inserting the game disk and launching it or by simply launching it) 

Step 10: You should see the game load as normal, but instead of the NSMBU logo you should see the Snowy SMBU logo.

Step 11: Enjoy!
