          Downloading
     Snowy Super Mario Bros. U

Requirements:
- An internet connection

Step 1: Decide if you want the latest changes or the latest stable release (I recommend the stable release)

Latest Changes Download: https://github.com/Kitty-Cats/SnowySMBU/archive/master.zip

IMPORTANT: When Downloading the latest changes the bfsar file will lose most of it's data and become invalid. when downloading from there MAKE SURE TO REPLACE THE DOWNLOADED BFSAR WITH ONE DOWNLOADED FROM HERE: [bfsar](https://github.com/Kitty-Cats/SnowySMBU/raw/master/content/CAFE/cafe_redpro_sound.bfsar)


Stable Release Download: https://github.com/Kitty-Cats/SnowySMBU/releases (download the SnowyU-Release1.zip file)

          HOW TO PLAY
         (Hacked Wii U)
---------------------------------

Requirements:
- Wii U
- SD Card with Homebrew
- A way to load Homebrew
- Loadiine GX2
- Your Legal Dump of NSMBU(with the 1.3 update files, not in WUP format)

Step 1: Create a folder named "games" inside the "wiiu" folder on your SD Card.

Step 2: Copy your legal dump of NSMBU to the "games" folder you created.

Step 3: Rename your dump(the one in the games folder) to "Snowy SUPER MARIO BROS. U [ARPP01]".

Step 4: Look inside your "Snowy SUPER MARIO BROS. U [ARPP01]" folder, you should see 'code', 'content' and 'meta' folders.

Step 6: Copy the content folder located alongside this readme.txt over the content folder on your SD Card.

Step 7: Power on your Wii U and launch the Homebrew Launcher using your preferred method.

Step 8: Load the 'Loadiine GX2' app and select 'Snowy SUPER MARIO BROS U', Launch the game and you should see the Snowy SMBU Logo instead of the NSMBU one.

Step 9: Enjoy!
