Works on Wii U but not tested on CEMU. But when using SDCafiine on Wii U, the custom music won't load(See below on how to play with Loadiine).

Continue to [here](howToPlay.md) for instructions on how to play Snowy SMBU.


Note: I am considering making an absolute beginner's guide for Snowy but as it takes so much time and effort I may not end up getting around to it, for now I would recommend that those who are new to Wii U hacking find a guide.(Youtube guides are not optimal as they can get outdated, but seeing as the Wii U flopped like it did I would be quite shocked if Nintendo released a new patch against homebrew exploits)

IMPORTANT: When Downloading from the green "Code" button and choosing to download zip, the bfsar file will lose most of it's data and become invalid. when downloading from there MAKE SURE TO REPLACE THE DOWNLOADED BFSAR WITH ONE DOWNLOADED FROM HERE: [bfsar](https://github.com/Kitty-Cats/SnowySMBU/raw/master/content/CAFE/cafe_redpro_sound.bfsar)


IMPORTANT: There is an issue where once you use the zoom out feature on the world map the game will lag for a few seconds when either walking up to & entering the castle or when walking to & from the secret level, because of this I would recommend to not use the zoom out feature. When playing with a Wii Remote/Wii U Pro Controller this will always happen due to the gamepad screen automaticly zooming out.


IMPORTANT: If the game crashes after pressing 'A' on the title screen(or when loading 1-tower) you are most likely using an old version of the game, if so please make sure it says 1.3 in the bottom right corner of the title screen. If not please dump the update files for the game with ddd or Dumpling(ddd dumps the update files combined with the game, whilst Dumpling dumps them separately), then merge with your dump(Dumpling only). If the game STILL crashes(for whatever reason) leave a comment on the release trailer and I'll try to help you.

              FAQ
---------------------------------

Q: I want to play the original NSMBU again, how do I do that?

A: Load your disc/download from the Wii U Home Menu, Loadiine is only useful for loading mods.

----------------------------------------

Q: How did you make this? Can I make something similar?

A: Yes! This was made primarily with the [Miyamoto! Level Editor](https://github.com/aboood40091/Miyamoto) with stuff outside of the levels being possible with [Switch Toolbox](https://github.com/KillzXGaming/Switch-Toolbox) and the injection of the music with [Citric Composer](https://github.com/Gota7/Citric-Composer)

----------------------------------------

Q: How might I learn how to use the tools that you made this with?

A: I learned how to use Miyamoto! via tutorials on the internet, but never found one for Switch Toolbox/Citric Composer, It hopefully shouldn't be too hard to figure out though.

-----------------------------------------

Q: Do you have any plans to expand Snowy U?

A: Not really, As making nothing but snow levels can be quite frustrating. However I might end up making another NSMBU hack/mod at some point.

------------------------------------------

Q: I want to play this on CEMU(Wii U Emulator), How can I do that?

A: I personally don't use CEMU anymore so haven't tested Snowy U on it, But if you want to do it you should find tutorials on how to play NSMBU mods on CEMU.

------------------------------------------

Q: Is this legal?

A: As long as you use your game backup of NSMBU dumped from your Wii U, This is legal. No game roms are being distributed here.
